# Beauty Routines

This application was made to keep your life organized. You'd be able to create a routine and organize them by day. If you need to edit, you can do so by editing your current routines or by deleting them. This is easy to use and can make your life easier!

# Motivation 

I created this because I needed a way to keep track of my skincare routine. There are other routines that need to be incorporated in my life as well.
